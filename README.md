# SCIA OpenAPI and ADM Demo Project

This is an example project demonstrating how to use SCIA Engineer's OpenAPI and Analysis Data Model (ADM)
to programmatically:

1.  Create a structural analysis model
2.  Run linear FEM calculation
3.  Read the FEM calculation results

## 🎯 Purpose

This example project is designed for both **structural engineers** who want to learn how to automate SCIA
Engineer workflows using C# and the OpenAPI, as well as professional software developers who want to use
SCIA as a background calculation engine for their projects. It provides a complete working example that
creates a 3D structural model, runs calculations, and extracts results programmatically.

## 🏗️ What This Demo Creates

The example utilizes Analysis Data Model (ADM) and Open API to create a **FEM structure** in SCIA Engineer
featuring:

-   **Materials**: Steel (S355) and Concrete (C30/37)
-   **Cross-sections**: HEA260 steel profile and 600x300mm concrete sections
-   **Structural Elements**:

    +   5 steel columns (C1-C5) connecting ground to top level
    +   3 steel beams (B1-B3) at the top level
    +   2 concrete slabs: top (S1) and bottom (S2)

    +   1 concrete wall (W1)
    +   Slab opening (O1) in the top slab
    +   Region with a different thickness in bottom slab

-   **Supports**:

    +   Fixed point supports (PS1-PS4) with free X-rotation at the bottom of columns C1-C4
    +   Fixed point support (PS5) at the bottom of column C5
    +   Surface support (SS1) under the bottom slab with elastic soil parameters

-   **Hinges**:

    +   Point hinges at the start and end of the beam B3 with free Y-rotation
    +   Linear hinges at the bottom and top of the wall

-   **Loads**:

    +   3 load cases (_LC1-LC3_)
    +   Line loads (forces and moments) on columns and beams in load case 1 (_LC1_)
    +   Surface load on top slab and point loads on column C5 in load case 2 (_LC2_)
    +   One load combination _LComb1_

After creating the structure, the app sends it to SCIA Engineer and starts a linear FEM
calculation. Then, results are read and printed in the console.

### System Requirements

See the [system requirements of SCIA Engineer](https://www.scia.net/en/support/faq/scia-engineer/installation/system-requirements).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/scia-garage/open-api-adm-dotnet.git
cd open-api-adm-dotnet
```

> [!NOTE]
> All CLI commands we show below need to be run in this directory

### 2. Verify SCIA Engineer Installation

Ensure SCIA Engineer is installed at the default location:

```shell
if exist "C:\Program Files\SCIA\Engineer25.0" (echo OK) else (echo Not found)
```

> [!NOTE]
> If SCIA Engineer is not installed under this location, you have to adapt the DLL paths in
> _OpenAPIAndADMDemo.csproj_ file! See [configuration](#️-configuration).

### 3. Open the project

-   With VS-Code

    +   Open VS-Code and go to _File -> Open Folder_ and open the _open-api-adm-dotnet_ folder  
        OR in the CLI type: `code .`
    +   Wait a couple of seconds for the pop-up about installing extensions recommended for this
        project to pop up or open the _Extensions_ tab (CTRL+E) and type `@recommended`
        in the search field
    +   Install all recommended extensions

-   With Visual Studio

    Simply open the solution file _open_api_adm_dotnet.sln_

### 4. Build the Project

-   Using CLI

    ```shell
    dotnet build open_api_adm_dotnet.sln
    ```

-   Or using VS-Code

    The default build task is defined in the _.vscode/tasks.json_.  
    Just go to: "Terminal -> Run Build Task" or Press Ctrl+Shift+B

-   Or using Visual Studio

    Build with Ctrl+Shift+B

The binaries are created in `OpenAPIAndADMDemo/bin/Debug/net48`

### 5. Test the demo application

```shell
dotnet run --project OpenAPIAndADMDemo
```

#### Expected Workflow

1.  Console application starts and initializes SCIA Engineer environment
2.  SCIA Engineer opens automatically
3.  A new empty project is created
4.  The demo builds the complete structural model using ADM
5.  Model is sent to SCIA Engineer (you'll see the 3D structure)
6.  **Press any key** when prompted to run the calculation
7.  Linear analysis is performed
8.  Results are extracted and displayed in the console
9.  **Press any key** to close SCIA Engineer

### 6. Debugging

-   Using VS-Code

    The debug configuration is defined in _.vscode/launch.json_. You only need to:

    +   Set a breakpoint anywhere in the code
    +   Press F5

-   Using Visual Studio

    +   Set a breakpoint anywhere in the code
    +   Press F5

## 🛠️ Configuration

### SCIA Engineer Version Configuration

The project is configured for SCIA Engineer 25.0. To use a different version:

1.  **Update ModelConstants.cs**:

    ```csharp
    public const string SciaVersion = "24.1"; // Change to your version
    ```

2.  **Update .csproj file** - Replace all instances of `Engineer25.0` with your version:

    ```xml
    <HintPath>C:\Program Files\SCIA\Engineer24.1\OpenAPI_dll\SCIA.OpenAPI.dll</HintPath>
    ```

### Custom Installation Path

If SCIA Engineer is installed in a non-standard location, update the paths in `OpenAPIAndADMDemo.csproj`
for **each** `<Reference>` item:

```xml
          <!--  Change this base path  -->
<HintPath>C:\Custom\Path\SCIA\Engineer25.0\OpenAPI_dll\SCIA.OpenAPI.dll</HintPath>
```

## 🧪 Experimenting Guide

### Adding New Materials

In ModelDirector.cs, the call `.SetupDefaultMaterials()` creates some basic materials.
Replace it with something like:

```csharp
.AddMaterial("Steel_S275", MaterialType.Steel, "S275", 210, 80, 0.3, 7850);
```

### Creating Different Geometry

To build a structural analysis model with a different geometry, modify the calls of `GeometryBuilder` in ModelDirector.cs:

```csharp
.AddNode("NewNode", x, y, z);
.AddLineMember("NewBeam", "StartNode", "EndNode", "CrossSection", Member1DType.Beam, "BeamsLayer");
```

The same applies for supports, hinges, load cases, loads and load combinations: modify
the calls of `SupportBuilder`, `HingeBuilder`, `LoadCaseBuilder`, `LoadBuilder` and `LoadCombinationBuilder`
respectively.

### Extracting Additional Results

The results are read in Program.cs using `ResultsManager`. Add additional calls to extract
more results. Remember to call `PrintAllResults` at the end

```csharp
ReadMemberStresses("Beam B1 : Stresses : Load case LC1", "LC1", "B1");
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Server timeout

```shell
2025-01-23 12:34:56.7890|ERROR|SCIA.OpenAPI.AdmToAdmServiceWrapper|Server start timeout. SCIA Engineer Application must be terminated manually!
```

SCIA Engineer didn't start within a timeout.

-   Close the demo
-   After some time, SCIA Engineer will eventually start. Close it.
-   Restart the demo

### Other issues

If you are still not able to start the example, it might help moving the .exe file to the SCIA
installation folder (by default `C:\Program Files\SCIA\Engineer25.0` )
